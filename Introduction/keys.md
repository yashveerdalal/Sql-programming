In SQL databases, keys are essential for identifying and managing records in tables. Here are the main types of keys you might encounter:

1. **Primary Key**:

   - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
   - Must contain unique values and cannot be NULL.
   - There can only be one primary key per table.

2. **Foreign Key**:

   - A field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.
   - Establishes a relationship between two tables.
   - Can contain duplicate values and NULLs, depending on the relationship.

3. **Unique Key**:

   - Ensures that all values in a column are different from one another.
   - Unlike primary keys, a table can have multiple unique keys, and they can allow NULL values (but only one NULL per unique constraint).

4. **Composite Key**:

   - A primary key that consists of two or more columns.
   - Used when a single column is not sufficient to uniquely identify records.

5. **Candidate Key**:

   - A column (or set of columns) that can qualify as a primary key.
   - Each candidate key must contain unique values and cannot be NULL.
   - There can be multiple candidate keys, from which one is selected as the primary key.

6. **Surrogate Key**:

   - An artificial key that is used to uniquely identify records.
   - Typically an auto-incrementing number, it doesnâ€™t have any business meaning.

7. **Natural Key**:

   - A key that has real-world meaning and is used to uniquely identify records.
   - For example, a Social Security Number or an email address.

8. **Alternate Key**:
   - A candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.
   - It can be used to enforce uniqueness in a table.

These keys help maintain data integrity and establish relationships between tables in relational database systems.
